What is CpChart?
===============

A project bringing composer support and PHP 5.3 standards to pChart 2.0 library.

The aim is to enable pChart library for use in modern frameworks, with the use of composer.phar.
All that will be done with the original files is to drop the PHP 4.* code and replace it with 
version 5.*. It will include renaming __construct functions, adding some basic annotations to functions,
'public' keyword to class properties and methods, as well as providing a namespace for the project.
No changes to functionality is planned or rewriting every pChart release into CpChart. New releases may
be ported if some really important stuff is added / fixed.

Where to get it?
================
For the time being at GitHub: https://github.com/szymach/CpChart
Will add it to packagist later.


How to install it?
==================

*To be added once the project reaches a usable version*
